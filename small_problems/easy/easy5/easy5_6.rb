# Letter Counter (Part 1)

# Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words and 
# returns a hash that shows the number of words of different sizes.

# Words consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.

def word_sizes(str)
  sizes = Hash.new(0)
  str.split.each do |word|
    sizes[word.length] += 1
  end
  sizes
end

## Examples ##
p word_sizes('Four score and seven.') #== { 3 => 1, 4 => 1, 5 => 1, 6 => 1 }
p word_sizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!') #== { 3 => 5, 6 => 1, 7 => 2 }
p word_sizes("What's up doc?") #== { 6 => 1, 2 => 1, 4 => 1 }
p word_sizes('') #== {}
